Component: task 5, player

### Comments

1. Using the original map of the game board, which is more accurate than design by ourselves.
Each functions' structure is well-designed.
2. The notes added for the functions are easy to understand.
3. Classified the different classes, such as some functions used by many times. When I have done a function, she helps me a lot to achieve this.
4. All the names of variants and functions are easy to see what will they do.The style of coding is consistent.
5. I think there are no errors so far. We had checked them out together when a task was done.
