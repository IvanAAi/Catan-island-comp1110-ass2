### Comments

1. The best feature is that he successfully achieved all the functions required.
2. The code was not commented enough, and I have added some comments when reviewing.
3. The method structure is appropriate, while class structure is my part of job.
4. The style is consistent throughout, and variables and methods are all properly named.
5. I think there is no error in the code.
