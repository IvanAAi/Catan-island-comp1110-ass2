# Features

In addition to the features that are auto-tested, the graphical user interface
of our project implements the following features:

*(Remove those that are unimplemented)*

- A simple placement viewer (Task 5)
- A basic playable game (Task 10)

List additional noteworthy features beyond those in the assignment
specification that you have added, if any.

## Player instructions

Use this section of the file to write any necessary instructions on
how to play your implementation of the game. You can assume the player
knows the game rules; the purpose of this section is to document how
to use any parts of your game GUI that are not intuitively obvious
(and not documented in the GUI itself).

This section is optional.

1. Roll Dices: A button represents a dice, press the one you would like to reroll for the next rolling. If you press
   wrong dices by accident, you can press the "Reset" button to rechoose them. Press the "Ready" button to end the
   rolling process.
2. Swap and Trade Resources: For swap, first choose the resource used to exchange (only the resource you already have
   can be chosen), then choose the resource you would like to swap for (according to which Joker you have).
3. Build Structures: just press the corresponding button on the board.
